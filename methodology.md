# Methodology

[← Back to Home](index.html)

This page explains how developments are selected, analyzed, and presented in this tracker.

---

## Selection Process

### Daily Review Workflow

**9:00 AM IST Daily:**
1. Monitor 30+ authoritative sources (regulatory bodies, legal publishers, major news outlets)
2. Identify developments published in last 24 hours
3. Apply selection criteria to filter signal from noise
4. Research context and verify facts
5. Draft analysis and publish entries

**Volume:** Typically 3-7 entries per day from 50-100+ developments reviewed.

---

## Selection Criteria

**A development makes the tracker if it meets at least one of these criteria:**

### 1. Regulatory Impact
- New legislation, regulations, or binding guidance
- Court decisions setting precedent or clarifying legal standards
- Enforcement actions revealing regulatory priorities
- Changes to existing compliance frameworks

**Examples:** EU AI Act implementation deadlines, FTC enforcement actions, landmark court rulings

### 2. Market Significance
- Major corporate policy changes affecting multiple stakeholders
- Industry consolidation or market exits
- Product launches with novel legal/regulatory implications
- Significant funding/investment decisions revealing market trends

**Examples:** Robin AI collapse, major M&A in legal tech, platform policy changes

### 3. Cross-Border Relevance
- Developments likely to influence regulation in multiple jurisdictions
- International cooperation or standards-setting
- Extraterritorial application of laws (like GDPR, AI Act)

**Examples:** US federal preemption of state laws (influences EU thinking), OECD AI principles

### 4. Precedent-Setting Nature
- First-of-its-kind regulatory action
- Novel legal arguments or interpretations
- Emerging regulatory approaches that may spread

**Examples:** First AI safety enforcement action, novel application of existing law to AI systems

---

## What Gets Excluded

**No matter how prominent, these don't make the tracker:**

- **Commentary-only articles** - Opinion pieces without new factual developments
- **Duplicate coverage** - Multiple outlets reporting same development (use most authoritative source)
- **Marketing disguised as news** - Vendor announcements without regulatory significance
- **Speculation** - Predictions about future regulation without concrete basis
- **Incremental updates** - Minor procedural steps in known legislative processes
- **Regional/local laws with limited scope** - Unless precedent-setting or unusual

---

## Analysis Approach

Each entry follows a structured format:

### 1. What Happened (Factual Summary)
- Objective description of the development
- Key facts, dates, parties involved
- No interpretation at this stage

**Standard:** Could be verified by anyone reading the source material.

### 2. Why It Matters (Practical Implications)
- Impact on businesses, practitioners, policymakers
- Compliance obligations or strategic considerations
- Audience-specific implications (e.g., "For Indian tech companies...")

**Standard:** Actionable insights a practitioner can use immediately.

### 3. Context (Broader Landscape)
- How this fits into ongoing regulatory trends
- Connections to other recent developments
- Historical precedents or similar situations
- What to watch next

**Standard:** Helps readers understand significance beyond immediate facts.

### 4. Weekly Commentary (Synthesis)
- Thematic analysis connecting multiple developments
- Trend identification across jurisdictions
- Strategic implications for different stakeholders

**Standard:** Adds value beyond individual entries through pattern recognition.

## Quality Standards

### Source Verification
- **Primary sources preferred:** Government websites, official court documents, regulatory announcements
- **Secondary sources vetted:** Established legal publishers, reputable news outlets with legal/tech expertise
- **Social media used cautiously:** Only for breaking news, always verified through authoritative sources
- **No anonymous sources:** All claims must be publicly attributable

### Fact-Checking
- Cross-reference claims across multiple sources when possible
- Verify dates, jurisdiction, parties involved
- Check for corrections or updates to initial reporting
- Note when facts are disputed or unclear

### Conflict of Interest
- No undisclosed commercial relationships with covered companies
- No sponsored content (this tracker accepts no advertising or payment)
- Legal analysis reflects professional judgment, not client interests
- When covering topics where I have professional involvement, disclose if material

---

## Timeliness

**Breaking News:** Updated within hours if material development with immediate compliance implications

**Standard Updates:** Published next business day at 9:00 AM IST

**Corrections:** Updated immediately with note explaining what changed and why

---

## Limitations & Disclaimers

### What This Tracker Is Not

**Not legal advice:** Analysis is educational and informational. Consult qualified counsel for specific situations.

**Not comprehensive:** Covers significant developments only. Not every AI/tech law development appears here.

**Not real-time:** 24-hour lag for most developments (unless breaking news with immediate impact).

**Not global:** English-language sources only. Heavy focus on US, EU, UK, India - less coverage of other jurisdictions.

### Known Biases

**Geographic:** Stronger coverage of US and EU due to source availability and language

**Sectoral:** Focus on AI and data protection over other tech law areas (by design)

**Commercial:** More coverage of B2B/enterprise implications than consumer issues

**Practitioner lens:** Analysis weighted toward compliance and risk management (my professional background)

These biases are acknowledged and where possible, I seek out diverse sources to balance them.

## Feedback & Corrections

**Spotted an error?** [Open an issue](https://github.com/advsanketshah/AI-Tech-Law-Tracker/issues/new) with:
- Entry date and headline
- What's incorrect
- Link to correct information

**Missed a major development?** Same process - open an issue with:
- Date of development
- Why it meets selection criteria
- Link to authoritative source

I review all submissions within 24 hours.

## Evolution

This methodology is not static. As the regulatory landscape evolves and I learn what's most valuable to readers, selection criteria and analysis approaches will adapt.

**Major methodology changes will be documented here with effective date.**

**Last updated:** December 15, 2025
