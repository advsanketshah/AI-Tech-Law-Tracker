Launching: AI & Tech Law Tracker

I'm building a daily-curated tracker of AI and Technology Law developments - with practitioner analysis on why each matters.

Week 1 highlights:
→ Trump's executive order vs. state AI laws - constitutional collision course
→ State AGs demand AI safety protocols from tech giants
→ Robin AI collapse signals legal AI funding crunch

Updates daily at 9 AM IST. What developments should I be tracking?
